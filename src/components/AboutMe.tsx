        Hey, I’m Bernardo, born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I’m passionate about
        technology, programming, and creative expression. Besides coding, I love
        reading and drawing — both help me develop creativity and attention to
        detail. I’m focused on building clean, efficient code and enjoy tackling
        projects that push me to grow. I value hard work, honesty, and constant
        self-improvement, always aiming to get better in everything I do.
      </p>
